# Algorithms

## What is an Algorithm?

- A set of instructions for solving a problem
- A sequence of steps that can be followed to complete a task
- A recipe

### Examples

_Bake a Cake_

- Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
- Mix flour, sugar, and baking soda in a bowl.
- Add 2 eggs, 1 cup milk, and 1tsp vanilla.
- Mix well.
- Pour into a greased baking pan.
- Bake for 30 minutes.

_Determine if Number is Even or Odd_

- Divide the number by 2.
- If the remainder is 0, the number is even.
- Otherwise, the number is odd.

_Find the Largest Number in a Set_

- Set the largest number to the first number in the list.
- For each number in the list:
  - If the number is larger than the largest number, set the largest number to the current number.
  - Otherwise, do nothing.
  - Repeat for each number in the list.

## Structured Programming

**Structured programming** forms the basis of all modern programming languages, and can be used to implement algorithms.

The three basic control structures are:

### Sequence

- Execute instructions order, one after the other.
- (Not out of order).

### Selection

- Choose between two or more **logical branches** based on a condition.
- "If-then-else"

### Iteration

- Repeat a set of instructions until a condition is met.
- "Looping"

**Where do we see these structures in the algorithms above?**
