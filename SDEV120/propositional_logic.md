# Propositional Logic

**Deductive logic** is a systematic way of thinking that allows us to determine the truth value of a statement based on the truth values of other statements.

**Propositional logic** is a type of deductive logic that deals with propositions.

**Boolean algebra** is a type of algebra that deals with propositions, named after George Boole.

## Propositions

**Propositions** are statements that are either true or false.

We can assign variables to propositions to make them easier to work with:

| Variable | Proposition    |
| :------- | :------------- |
| A        | It is raining. |
| B        | It is cold.    |
| C        | It is snowing. |

More meaningful variable names can also be used:

| Variable | Proposition    |
| :------- | :------------- |
| Raining  | It is raining. |
| Cold     | It is cold.    |
| Snowing  | It is snowing. |

## Truth Values

**Truth values** are the values that propositions can have: true or false. These are also called Boolean values.

**Truth tables** are tables that show all possible truth values for propositions in a problem.

## Implications

...

Given a set of assumptions, We can use initial truth values to determine the truth values of other propositions.

**Logical connectives** are symbols that are used to combine propositions into more complex propositions.
