# UML

<!-- ref: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ok6_Q5JWYdK6HiAb7YKZR1Aw13tNrHm8aajtnA-ZUFc/edit -->

## What is it?

**UML** = Unified Modeling Language

- Standardized way to model software. 
- Visual language that allows us to communicate the design of a system.
- Primary authors are Grady Booch, James Rumbaugh, and Ivar Jacobson.
- Solved problem of competing / differing documentation styles.
    - You can show UML to someone anywhere in the world and they will understand it.

These diagrams capture information about various contexts.

- Roles of people building / maintaining / using the software.
- Hardware involved.
- Functionality of the system, in various scopes and levels of detail.

#### What is it not
- UML is _not_ a programming language. It's a visual description language.

## What is it used for?

- Planning new functionality for software.
- Reference when modifying existing functionality.
- Communicating with stakeholders (documentation).
- Training new team members.

- Timing Diagram

## Types of UML Diagrams

From [An introduction to the Unified Modeling Language - IBM Developer](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/an-introduction-to-uml/):

> "The most useful, standard UML diagrams are: use-case diagram, class diagram, sequence diagram, statechart diagram, activity diagram, component diagram, and deployment diagram."

### Use Case Diagram

#### Description

- Represent functionality, actors, and how these relate to each other in the context of a system.
- "High level" scope; not much detail.
- Useful for planning new functionality.
- Useful for communicating with stakeholders.

#### Key components

- Actors

        </a>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

#### Description

- Shows how entities (classes) in a system relate to each other.
- Classes contain self-describing attributes and methods.
- Connectors between classes show **cardinality**; how many of one class can be related to another class.
    - https://www.uml-diagrams.org/multiplicity.html
    - Also... Crow's feet notation.

| Multiplicity | Option | Cardinality                             |
| :----------- | :----- | :-------------------------------------- |
| 0..0         | 0      | Collection must be empty                |
| 0..1         |        | No instances or one instance            |
| 1..1         | 1      | Exactly one instance                    |
| 0..*         | *      | Zero or more instances                  |
| 1..*         |        | At least one instance                   |
| 5..5         | 5      | Exactly 5 instances                     |
| m..n         |        | At least m but no more than n instances |

- Entities can be concrete or abstract. From above:
  - Concrete examples:
    - Person
    - ??? (what else?)
  - Abstract examples:
    - Comment
    - ??? (what else?)

#### Key components

- Classes
- Attributes
- Methods
- Relationships between classes (cardinality)
 <br>
<span class="demo">walkthrough:</span> For dog walking service, how would I show…
- Dog walker and client (person)?
- Dogs that he/she is scheduled to walk?
- Relationships?
- Any other classes needed?

#### Custom

It’s useful to have a baseline knowledge of UML if you work with software at all. Even rough sketches can save valuable communication time.

Mix and match to suit your needs.

# Set Theory

<!-- ref: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xrltP4pU9FkZtHtX5-glQ-6xtKQ17o1C2PjoDaTsWKo/edit -->

> Bertrand Russell and Ernst Zermelo independently found the simplest and best known paradox, now called Russell's paradox: consider "the set of all sets that are not members of themselves", which leads to a contradiction since it must be a member of itself and not a member of itself.

## Definition of a Set

A **set** is a collection of objects with...
- No duplicates.
- No order.


## Set Notation

- Sets are usually assigned a capital letter. 
- Elements are wrapped in curly braces.
- Objects in a set are called **elements**.
- Numbers of elements in a set are called **cardinality**.

### Examples

- Let A be the set of all even numbers between 1 and 10.
- Let B be all integers.
- Let C be all distinct letters in the word "apple".
- Let D = { 'dog', 'cat', 'elephant' }

### Logical Connectives

Logical connectives (and, or) are usually rounded when used in set theory.

| Operation | Symbol (alt) | Symbol (Set Theory) | Description |
| :-------: | :----------: | :-----------------: | :---------: |
|    and    |      ∧       |          ∩          | conjunction |
|    or     |      ∨       |          ∪          | disjunction |

### Subsets and Supersets

A **subset** is a set that contains all elements of another set.
A **proper subset** is a subset that is not equal to the original set.

Examples:
- { 1, 2, 3 } is a subset of { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }
- { 1, 2, 3 } is a proper subset of { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }
- { 1, 2, 3 } is not a proper subset of { 1, 2, 3 }

## Venn Diagrams

    </span>

</figure>

Venn diagrams help us visualize relationships between sets.

- Sets represented as circles.
- Overlapping area represents intersection of sets (logical and).
- Overlapping + non-overlapping area represents union of sets (logical or).
- What would XOR look like?
