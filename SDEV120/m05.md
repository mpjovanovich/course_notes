# Arrays

## Definitions

- An array is a series or list of values in computer memory.
- An array is a way to store multiple related variables of the same data type.
- An array is a container with n elements, where n is the length of the array.

## Descriptions

- An array is a set of elements (values or things) that can be accessed by address (their position within the array).
    - Address = position = index
- The things the array contains must all have the same data type in a strongly typed programming language (Python, C languages, Java…)

```python
## Strongly typed - elements must all same data type.
auto_types = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
```

```python
## Weakly typed - elements can be anything.
random_junk = ["Ford", 1, True]
```

## Looping Through Arrays

### Getting the Length of an Array in Python

We can use the “len” function to get the length of an array.

```python
## After this code is executed the “length” variable will hold an integer
## with the number of elements of the array
arr = ['a','b','c','d']
length = len( arr )
print(length) # Will print 4
```
### Using a counter variable to access an array by index.

We can use a counter variable to access an array element by position as we move through a loop.

```python
arr = ['a','b','c','d']
## We can create a counter variable that we can then use to
## access an element by index - by its position within the array.
for i in range( len( arr ) ):
    print( 'The current index is: ' + str(i) )
    print( 'The array value at this position is: ' + arr[i] )
```

### Getting item(s) from an ordered list by index. 

Use cases:
- What is the fourth stop on the bus line?
- demo: m06_get_nth_largest_city.py

### Getting item(s) from an ordered list by range.

Use cases:
- What are the first / last n items in the list?
    - demo: m06_get_top_n_largest_cities.py
    - demo: How would we change the program to get the last n items?
- Print every nth item in a list.
    - demo: m06_alphabet_get_every_nth.py

### Strings are Arrays!

Anything we can do with an array, we can do with a string.

```python
longWord = ['Acetylcholinergic neurotransmission',]

for letter in longWord:
    print( letter )
```

<span class="demo">demo:</span> Write a program that prompts the user to enter an animal name. Then prompt to enter a second animal name. If the entries are the same print “Match”, otherwise print “Not a match”.

- [m06_string_comparison.py](https://github.com/mpjovanovich/ivy_tech/blob/main/SDEV120_Computing_Logic/m06_string_comparison.py)
- How can we rewrite m06_alphabet_get_every_nth.py so that it works with any string? 
    - It already will - just plug it in! (Do in class)


# Parallel Arrays

## Definition

**Parallel arrays** are a set of arrays that store related information for a given index / position.

E.g.:  Here are two arrays below - name and age. The parallel arrays give the data a table structure. By looking at some index into the arrays we can extract a “row” of data which are related.

| index | name[] | age[] |
| 0 | Terri Gourd | 23 |
