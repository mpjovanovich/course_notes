# Arrays

## Definitions

- An array is a series or list of values in computer memory.
- An array is a way to store multiple related variables of the same data type.
- An array is a container with n elements, where n is the length of the array.

## Descriptions

- An array is a set of elements (values or things) that can be accessed by address (their position within the array).
    - Address = position = index
- The things the array contains must all have the same data type in a strongly typed programming language (Python, C languages, Java…)

```python
## Strongly typed - elements must all same data type.
auto_types = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
```

```python
## Weakly typed - elements can be anything.
random_junk = ["Ford", 1, True]
```

## Looping Through Arrays

### Getting the Length of an Array in Python

We can use the “len” function to get the length of an array.

```python
## After this code is executed the “length” variable will hold an integer
## with the number of elements of the array
arr = ['a','b','c','d']
length = len( arr )
print(length) # Will print 4
```
### Using a counter variable to access an array by index.

We can use a counter variable to access an array element by position as we move through a loop.

```python
arr = ['a','b','c','d']
## We can create a counter variable that we can then use to
## access an element by index - by its position within the array.
for i in range( len( arr ) ):
    print( 'The current index is: ' + str(i) )
    print( 'The array value at this position is: ' + arr[i] )
```

### Getting item(s) from an ordered list by index. 

Use cases:
- What is the fourth stop on the bus line?
- demo: m06_get_nth_largest_city.py

### Getting item(s) from an ordered list by range.

Use cases:
- What are the first / last n items in the list?
    - demo: m06_get_top_n_largest_cities.py
    - demo: How would we change the program to get the last n items?
- Print every nth item in a list.
    - demo: m06_alphabet_get_every_nth.py

### Strings are Arrays!

Anything we can do with an array, we can do with a string.

```python
longWord = ['Acetylcholinergic neurotransmission',]

for letter in longWord:
    print( letter )
```

<span class="demo">demo:</span> Write a program that prompts the user to enter an animal name. Then prompt to enter a second animal name. If the entries are the same print “Match”, otherwise print “Not a match”.

- [m06_string_comparison.py](https://github.com/mpjovanovich/ivy_tech/blob/main/SDEV120_Computing_Logic/m06_string_comparison.py)
- How can we rewrite m06_alphabet_get_every_nth.py so that it works with any string? 
    - It already will - just plug it in! (Do in class)


# Parallel Arrays

## Definition

**Parallel arrays** are a set of arrays that store related information for a given index / position.

E.g.:  Here are two arrays below - name and age. The parallel arrays give the data a table structure. By looking at some index into the arrays we can extract a “row” of data which are related.

| index | name[ ] | age[ ] |
| :---- | :----: | :---- |
| 0 | Terri Gourd | 23 |
| 1 | Jonny Chocolate | 17 |
| 2 | Sven Iglinsin| 34 |
| 3 | The Q | 999999 |

This example had just two arrays, but there may be as many as needed.

<span class="demo">demo:</span> Write a program that first prompts a user to enter the names of a student then the student’s final grade. Do this until the user types “done”. Print each student’s name and total score and exit the program.
- demo: m06_enter_student_grades.py
- [m06_enter_student_grades.py](https://github.com/mpjovanovich/ivy_tech/blob/main/SDEV120_Computing_Logic/m06_string_comparison.py)

## Removing and Updating From Parallel Arrays

When we delete from a set of parallel arrays, all arrays need a value removed (by index).
- We can’t use the “remove” method in this case - we don’t know what the corresponding values for the parallel arrays will be.
- We can instead use the Python index function to find the index of a given value.

```python
## After this code is executed the "target_index" variable will hold an integer
## with the array index of the argument that was passed in
arr = ['a','b','c','d']
target_index = arr.index( 'd' )
```

<span class="demo">demo:</span> m06_update_array_parallel.py

<span class="demo">demo:</span> m06_remove_array_parallel.py
- How do the indexes of other elements change if we delete one value?
- If I remove Alf, what is the index of Cory?


## Searching Arrays

### Algorithms

- An algorithm is a set of instructions, much like a recipe. 
- Common algorithms have names. This gives us a vocabulary so that others to know what you’re describing.
- The algorithm we’re using for search is called linear search.

### Linear Search

#### Check if Array Contains an Element

- How do we figure out if an array contains some element?
    - Initialize a flag variable - a boolean variable that tells whether the item was found. This will start with a value of “False”.
    - Use a loop to iterate through each item, and compare against the search target.
    - If the search target is found then set the flag variable to “True”.

<span class="demo">demo:</span> m06_search_array.py

#### Find Index of Element in an Array

<span class="demo">demo:</span> We can write our own function value to get the index of an element.
- Review: A magic value is a constant that has some predefined meaning.
- We will use a value of -1 to mean “not found”.
- modify m06_search_array.py to return an index

Python has an index function, but what happens if it doesn't find anything?
- In the Python implementation you’ll get a runtime error…

## Loop Efficiency

### Using Break and Continue
If we have a loop that was set to run a set number of times, but it’s doing work that is no longer necessary, we should break out of that loop.
- **break** keyword - exits the loop immediately
- **continue** keyword - skips the rest of the loop body and goes to the next iteration
- <span class="demo">demo:</span> walkthrough flowchart p. 249
- <span class="demo">demo:</span> revisit / fix m06_search_array.py

### Avoiding Redundant Calculations

Whether or not a line of code is included in the body of a loop makes a difference on how many times that line will execute.

Anything that doesn’t have to be changed inside the loop should be calculated outside of the loop - even if it’s a variable that we may use in the loop body.

# Overload Topics

## Incorporating Graphics into Software

In most programming languages you would use a third party library to build charts and graphs. These are bundled pieces of code that are not a part of the standard libraries that are included with a language.

demo: https://github.com/mpjovanovich/k-means_plus_plus
- python3 kmeans.py 300 2 5 1 7 2 result_standard.png
- python3 kmeans.py 300 2 5 2 7 2 result_plus_plus.png

The squared error for the two runs (standard = 109.23, plus plus = 65.89) might be understood by a statistician, but representing the data graphically gives a better mental model of what’s happening.

What do the two scatter plots tell us about which algorithm did a better job clustering the data points?
