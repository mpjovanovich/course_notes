# Arrays

## Definitions

- An array is a series or list of values in computer memory.
- An array is a way to store multiple related variables of the same data type.
- An array is a container with n elements, where n is the length of the array.

## Descriptions

- An array is a set of elements (values or things) that can be accessed by address (their position within the array).
    - Address = position = index
- The things the array contains must all have the same data type in a strongly typed programming language (Python, C languages, Java…)

```python
## Strongly typed - elements must all same data type.
auto_types = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
```

```python
## Weakly typed - elements can be anything.
random_junk = ["Ford", 1, True]
```

## Looping Through Arrays

### Getting the Length of an Array in Python

We can use the “len” function to get the length of an array.

```python
## After this code is executed the “length” variable will hold an integer
## with the number of elements of the array
arr = ['a','b','c','d']
length = len( arr )
print(length) # Will print 4
```
