# Logic Gates

For an excellent logic gate sandbox, see: [Logic.ly](https://logic.ly/demo).

## Foundations

- Computers recognize only two states, based on the presence or absence of an electrical signal.
  - High voltage = 1 = true
  - Low voltage = 0 = false
- A **logic gate** is a device that performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.
- A **circut** is a collection of logic gates that work together to perform a specific task.

## Basic Gates

The logical connectives that we've learned so far have corresponding logic gates.

The truth table for each gate matches the truth table for the corresponding logical connective.
