# What is a Computer Program?

## Layers of Abstraction

* Application
    * The program
* Human written code
    * Natural language code, e.g. Python 
        * 3rd gen
    * Assembly language 
        * 2nd gen
* Compiled (machine created) code 
    * Machine code
        * 1st gen
    * CPU instructions
        * Uses common instruction set
        * Numerically encoded - integers
            * binary - for computers
            * hex - for humans
* Logic gates
    * Instructions are implemented with logic gates.
* Transistors
* Electrons
