# This is an h1

<!-- 
    Use img HTML tag instead of markdown. Markdown isn't flexible enough - need to be able to resize images quickly.
    Not sure why the transform is leaving original size bounding box, but can probably fix with CSS. 
-->
<!-- The wrapper span is needed to allow the image to be resized... who knows why. -->
<span style="display: inline-block;">
