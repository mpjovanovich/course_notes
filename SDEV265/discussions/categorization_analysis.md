# Categorization Analysis

_Prior to breaking out:_

Review the following categorization based methods of prioritizing requirements. Analyze strengths and limitations of each.

E.g.: https://itamargilad.com/why-impact-effort-prioritization-doesnt-work/

- Optimism bias (underestimate of effort)
- Overestimate of impact
- Ambigiuity in any of the criteria

_Breakout:_

Find release notes for any software product. Place items from the release in categories from the methods.

Imagine some items that could have been released, but didn't make the cut. Place these into categories.

You will need to show your items when we reconvene, so have a way to visually present your findings.
