### Assignment Description

There are many effective ways to organize and track requirements. In this assignment we will use GitHub tools to create a product backlog and a sprint backlog. This will allow us to track manage requirements and track the progress of our project in a way that is consistent with Agile development practices.

_Reference:_

It may be helpful to view the following video before attempting the assignment. The interface has changed slightly since the video was made:

### Instructions

#### A. Create GitHub Project

1. From your product repository, navigate to the projects tab and create a GitHub project.
   1. Title your project appropriately.
   1. Use the "table" template.
   1. Make sure that your new project is set to public visibility.

_Reference:_

- [Adding your project to a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-your-project/adding-your-project-to-a-repository)

#### B. Configure Home Tab

1. Name your table tab "Home"
1. Create a label for "user story".
   1. Show the "Labels" column on the home tab of your project.
1. Create a new column for the "Home" view of the project.
   1. Name this column "Priority".
   1. Set the field type to "Single select".
   1. Add options for "Critical", "High", "Medium", and "Low".
   1. Set a color scheme for the new options (click the context menu for the column and selecting "Edit values...).
1. In the Status column, click "Edit values...". Change the "Todo" option to "Backlog".

#### C. Add User Stories

1. Create at least five issues for your user stories. These will form our initial product backlog.
   1. The title of the issue should be the short form user story description: `“As a ___ I want to ___ so ___”.`.
   1. In the details pane of the issue, develop your user story into a scenario. These should focus on the technical/system requirements rather than the user requirements (how will the user story be “achieved” via the technology you’re using).
   1. Tag the issues with the label “user story”.
   1. Assign a priority to the issue. Make at least one high, one medium, and one low priority item.
   1. Assign the issue to a developer.
   1. Assign an estimated level of effort to each in the details pane of the issue.
   1. Add the issues to your project.
   1. Assign them to the backlog of the current development iteration.

#### D. Create Sprint Tab

1. Create a new view under the project top level page.
1. Title the new view “Sprint [current date]”, subbing in the current date.
1. Using the dropdown arrow, change the layout to “Board”.
1. Move at least two user stories from your backlog to the current sprint.
