Multiple student feedback that they don't understand what was applied coming out of the course.
Concepts are lost in complex labs.
Need to put my own boredom aside and sympathise with students' current experience level.

Labs to simplify / remove / fix:
- Grocery

END OF COURSE ANONYMOUS SURVEY:
- Rate each lab: I understood the concepts from this lab (not at all - very well)
- I believe that I would learn better if the labs were broken into smaller pieces
- On a scale from 1-10
    1 = labs are simple but are "toy problems"
    10 = labs are complex but demonstrate production level code
