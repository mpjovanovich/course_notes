## Local Development Environment

- A **local development environment** is a place to write and test code.
- There may be several **environments**, each with its own server(s):
  - Development
  - Testing
  - Staging
  - Production

### XAMPP

XAMPP is multiple programs that work together to provide a local development environment.

- X = Cross-platform
- A = Apache
- M = MariaDB
- P = PHP
- P = Perl

#### JavaScript (review):

PHP = **PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor**

- PHP is a **server-side** programming language.
- The program that runs PHP is called the **PHP interpreter**.
- The PHP interpreter runs on the server.

#### MariaDB

- MariaDB is a **database server**.
- Just like a web server, but fetches DB data instead of files.
- Predecessor to MySQL.
  - MySQL is owned by Oracle.
  - MariaDB is open source.

#### Summary

| Component                 | What is it? | Where does it run?  |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| JavaScript                | A language  | A browser           |
| PHP                       | A language  | PHP Interpreter     |
| PHP Interpreter           | A program   | A web server        |
| Apache (web server)       | A program   | An operating system |
| SQL                       | A language  | A database server   |
| MariaDB (database server) | A program   | An operating system |

    </figcaption>
</figure>

- A URL is a **Uniform Resource Locator**.

### Protocol

- The protocol tells the browser how to communicate with the server.
- HTTP = **HyperText Transfer Protocol**
  - The protocol used to transfer web pages.
- HTTPS = **HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure**
  - Uses SSL/TLS to encrypt the connection.

### Domain Name

- An **IP address** is a unique identifier for a computer on a network.
  - IP addresses are for computers and nerds.
- **DNS (Domain Name System)** is a service that translates hostnames to IP addresses.
  - Domain names are for humans.
  - It's just a lookup table.

### Localhost

- **localhost** is a special hostname that refers to the local machine.
- We can ping the localhost to get the IP address.

```bash
$ ping localhost
```

### Port

- Ports are used to identify which program should receive the data.
- A program is said to be 'listening' on a port.

#### Default ports:

If no port is specified, the browser will use the default port for the protocol.

| Protocol | Port |
| -------- | ---- |
| HTTP     | 80   |
| HTTPS    | 443  |
| MariaDB  | 3306 |

### Path

- The path is the location of the resource on the server.
- The **root** of our web server is the _htdocs_ folder.
- For this class:
  - **http://localhost:80/SDEV255/**

<p class="demo">Note:</p>

You may want to re-clone your git repo into the htdocs folder.
