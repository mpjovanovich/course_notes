# Intro to Loops

## Why Loops?

- Loops are commonly used to:
  - repeat a block of code
  - iterate over a collection of data
- Loops can run zero to infinite times depending on the condition and inputs.
- **Iteration** = one execution of the loop body.

## Psuedocode

```python
for item in collection:
    # loop body
```

```python
while entry_condition == True:
    # loop body
```

# Definite Loops

Used when we know in advance how many times we want to iterate.

## "for" Loops

Used when we know exactly how many times the loop should run.

- Initialize loop control variable.
- Test loop control variable.
- Alter loop control variable.
- Test until the entry condition is false.

Python doesn't have a traditional `for` loop; most languages do.

### "C style" Syntax

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    /////////////////////////////////////////
    // This is the actual loop
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        printf("%d\n", i);
    }
    /////////////////////////////////////////

    return 0;
}
```

## "foreach" Loops

- Many languages offer a `foreach` loop.
- Convenient way to iterate over a collection of data.

### Python Syntax

```python
for item in collection:
    # loop body
```

- `collection` is a list, tuple, or other iterable object.
- `item` can be any valid variable name.
- `item` will be assigned to each item in the collection in order.

### The range() Function

```python
## There are three "overloads" for the range function, so we can
## Write a python loop in different ways. These are all the same:
for i in range( 0, 10, 1 ):
      ## do some work ten times
for i in range( 0, 10 ):
      ## do some work ten times
for i in range( 10 ):
	## do some work ten times
```

- Range returns a list of numbers.
- We can then iterate over the list.
- The i is optional.
  - ```python
    for _ in range( 10 ):
        ## do some work ten times
    ```

- m05_print_multiples.py

### Changing the Step

- The **counter** does not have to increment / decrement by one.
- We can change the **step size**.

```python
for i in range( 10, 101, 10 ):
    ## do some work using the numbers 10, 20, ..., 100
```

### Off by One Errors

- Be mindful of the inclusiveness of the range function.
- **Start inclusive** and **end exclusive**.
- $[start, end)$
- When using while, also be mindful of < vs <= and > vs >=.

```python
## Prints 0-9
for i in range( 0, 10, 1 ):
    print( i )
```

# Nested Loops

- A **nested loop** is a loop inside another loop.
- The inner loop is executed completely for each iteration of the outer loop.
- The loop body is offset by indenting the code block for the body

```python
## Outer loop
for i in range( 10 ):
    ## Inner loop
    for j in range( 10 ):
        print( i, j )
```

- We don't have to use i and j, but it's a convention

<p class="demo">Walkthrough:</p>

What is the output of this program?

```python
# OUTER LOOP
for i in range( 0, 2, 1 ):
    # This statement is in the outer loop
    print( "Outer loop started: " + str(i) )

    # INNER LOOP
    for j in range( 0, 2, 1 ):
        # This statement is part of the inner loop
        print( "Inner loop started: " + str(j) )
        # Do some work...
        print( "Inner loop complete: " + str(j) )

    # We can have more code in the outer loop after the
    # inner loop has finished.
    print( "Outer loop complete: " + str(i) )
```

Tracking variables:

| Outer, i | Inner, j | x   |
| -------- | -------- | --- |
| 0        | 0        | 0   |
| ...      | ...      | ... |

<p class="demo">Walkthrough:</p>

What is the output of this program?

```python
x = 0

# OUTER LOOP
for i in range( 0, 3, 1 ):
    x += i
    print( f"i = {i}, j = --, x = {x}" )

    # INNER LOOP
    for j in range( 0, 3, 1 ):
        x += j
        print( f"i = {i}, j = {j}, x = {x}" )
```
