# Secure Information Systems

## New Challenges to Ensure Secure Information Systems

### Complexity of Systems

Increasing complexity offers new avenues for attack.

- Mobile Computing
- Cloud Computing
- Social Media
- IoT
- Big Data
- AI
- Blockchain

Each new device connected to the Internet is a potential entry point for an attacker.

### Bring Your Own Device

**Bring your own device (BYOD)** = employees use their own devices to access company data and applications.

Pros:
- Employee
    - More familiar with own device.
    - (Reportedly) more productive.
    - (Reportedly) more satisfied.
- Company
    - Can reduce need for IT support.
    - Can reduce need for training.
    - Can attract and retain talent due to flexibility of work environment.

Cons:
- Security risks
    - Employees may not keep their devices up to date.
    - Employees may not use strong passwords.
    - Employees may not use antivirus software.
    - Employees may not use a firewall.
    - Employees may not use encryption.
    - Employees may not use a VPN.
    - Employees may not use two-factor authentication.
    - Employees may not use a screen lock.
    - Employees may not use a password manager.
    - Employees may not use a privacy screen.
    - Employees may not use a privacy filter.


### Sophistication of Cybercrime

Sophistication and level or organization of cybercrime is increasing.
- Organized crime (large groups)
    - Dark web
    - Sell services/exploits to highest bidder

## Perpetrators of Cybercrime

| Perpetrator | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| Carless Insider | Employee who accidentally exposes information. |
| Malicious Insider | Employee who intentionally exposes information. |
| Cybercriminal | Individual who uses computers, networks, and the Internet to perpetrate crime. |
| Hacktivist | Individual who hacks computers or Web sites in an attempt to promote a political ideology. |
| Lone Wolf | Individual who acts alone to perpetrate a malicious act. |
| Cyberterrorist | Individual who uses computers and the Internet to cause harm to a civilian population to further a political agenda. |

### Other Applications

- **Cyberwarfare** = state-sponsored attacks on information systems.
- **Cyberespionage** = state-sponsored attacks on information systems to steal information.

#### Case Study: Stuxnet

## Attack Types 

| Attack Type | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| Spam | The use of email systems to send unsolicited email to large numbers of people. |
| Phishing | The act of fraudulently using email to try to get the recipient to reveal personal data. |
| Smishing | A variation of phishing that involves the use of texting. |
| Vishing | Similar to smishing except that the victims receive a voice mail message telling them to call a phone number or access a Web site. |
| Social engineering | The use of deception to trick individuals into divulging data needed to gain access to an information system or network. |
| Rootkit | A set of programs that enables its user to gain administrator-level access to a computer without the end user’s consent or knowledge. Once installed, the attacker can gain full control of the system and even obscure the presence of the rootkit from legitimate system administrators. |
| Trojan horse | A seemingly harmless program in which malicious code is hidden. A victim on the receiving end of a Trojan horse is usually tricked into opening it because it appears to be useful software from a legitimate source. |
| Virus | A piece of programming code, usually disguised as something else, that causes a computer to behave in an unexpected and usually undesirable manner. |
| Worm | A harmful program that resides in the active memory of the computer and duplicates itself. Worms differ from viruses in that they can propagate without human intervention, often sending copies of themselves to other computers by email. |
| Advanced persistent threat | A network attack in which an intruder gains access to a network and stays there—undetected—with the intention of stealing data over a long period of time. |

## Types of Cyberattacks

### Ransomware

Malware that threatens to publish the victim's data or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid.

- Ransoms pait in bitcoin.
- Very lucrative business for cybercriminals
- Can halt essential operations for organizations. B/c of this ransom is often paid.

#### High profile examples: 

[A timeline of the biggest ransomware attacks](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/crypto/a-timeline-of-the-biggest-ransomware-attacks/). 

A few of these:
- Colonial Pipeline (2021)
    - Oil flow shut off for 5 days
    - Caused a gas run
    - Caused power outages, including in healthcare facilities
    - Paid $4.4 million in ransom
- University of California at San Francisco (2020)
    - School of medicine hacked.
    - Paid $1.14 million in ransom


### Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)

Cyberattack in which a large number of computers (or other devices) are used to flood a server with requests for information in order to overload the server and deny service to legitimate users.

- Server is so busy handling illigitimate requests that it can't handle legitimate requests.
- Utilizes **botnets**.
    - Network of computers that have been infected with malware that allows them to be controlled remotely.
    - "Zombie" computers.
    - Infected machines do nothing until botnet is activated.

#### Legitimate Uses of Bots

- Search engines
- Web site monitoring, archiving, mirroring, indexing, content filtering, and categorization
- Automated online assistants

### Data Breach

Intentional or unintentional release of secure or private/confidential information to an untrusted environment.

- [Data Breach Statistics](https://www.varonis.com/blog/data-breach-statistics/)
    - Good all around.
- [List of Data Breaches and Cyber Attacks in 2023](https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/list-of-data-breaches-and-cyber-attacks-in-2023)
    - See "Top data breach stats..."

## Consequences of a Cyberattack

- Loss of revenue
- Loss of intellectual property
- Loss of productivity
- Loss of reputation / customer trust

## Preventing Cyberattacks

### Hashing and Encryption

Encryption used to protect data in storage or as it is transmitted.

Hashing used to verify integrity of data.

- [What is difference between Encryption and Hashing?](https://www.encryptionconsulting.com/education-center/encryption-vs-hashing)
    - See “Hashing and Encryption Use Cases”

_Hashing demo_

```bash
## One letter off...
echo "This is unencrypted." > tmp1.txt
echo "this is unencrypted." > tmp2.txt
md5sum tmp1.txt
md5sum tmp2.txt
```

_Encryption demo_

```bash
## Encrypt then view file...
gpg -c tmp1.txt
rm tmp1.txt
## Then decrypt...
gpg -o tmp1.txt tmp1.txt.gpg
```

### User and Group Permissions

Used to control access to files and directories.

_Read only demo_

```bash
## Note the permissions on tmp1.txt
ls -l
## Set tmp1.txt to read only
chmod 444 tmp1.txt
ls -l
## Now we can't edit the file.
```

### Separation of Duties

Divide responsibilities for a system among multiple people / groups to:
- Prevent damage from ignorant users
- Limit damage from a single person

Example:
- Should the (Database Administrator) DBA be able to access/view user information?
- Should user be able to delete a database table?


### CIA Security Triad

- Confidentiality
    - Only authorized users can access sensitive data.
- Integrity
    - Data is accurate and complete.
    - Only authorized users can modify data.
- Availability
    - Data is accessible when needed.
    - "Uptime"
    - e.g., might aim for 99.999% availability.
